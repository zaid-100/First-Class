Curly Fries
</h1>
<p>
Curly Fries are inherently superior compared to regular fries. I've gotten into arguments with many of my peers that think "they're the same"
BUT THEY ARE NOT! Curly Fries have that crispy texture to them which when you put in your mouth, and subsequently bite, oozes out a surge of potato taste that beats even the most perfect straight fries.
Add in some ketchup or mayonnaise (whatever keeps you up at night) and enjoy moments of sweet pleasure you've never felt.
